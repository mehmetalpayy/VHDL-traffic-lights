# Traffic Lights Project

This project encompasses a traffic lights system designed and simulated using VHDL programming language.

# Project Description

This project involves a VHDL design that simulates the fundamental functions of a real traffic lights system. The design can be used to control traffic lights at intersections.

The project generally includes the following features:
-Simulates the sequencing of traffic lights comprising red, yellow, and green signals.
-Manages the light states individually for each traffic direction.
-Allows programmable transition times based on traffic density.
-Includes special conditions that can be controlled by the user, such as manually pausing or initiating traffic flow.

# File Structure

-T23_TrafficLights.vhd: Main VHDL design file.
-T23_ProcedureInProcessTb: Test bench file.
-Getting Started

To run the simulation and observe the traffic lights system in action, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/mehmetalpayy/VHDL-traffic-lights/tree/main.git
Open the VHDL simulation environment (e.g., Xilinx ISE, ModelSim).
Compile the T23_TrafficLights.vhd file.
Compile the T23_ProcedureInProcessTb file for testing purposes.
Simulate the design and observe the traffic lights behavior.

# Usage

The VHDL design provides a foundation for simulating a traffic lights system. You can modify the parameters in the code to customize the behavior of the traffic lights according to your requirements. Additionally, you can incorporate this design into a larger system or project by integrating it with other VHDL modules or components.
